## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?

The function keyword, an optional name, zero or more parameters, a code block, and an optional return statement.

- How do you call a function?

Write the name of the function and place the () next to it.

- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

The parameter acts as a placeholder as it is a variable whose value is not known until the function is called and we pass an argument. While the function is not run, the parameter holds the value of the argument. When we define a function, we declare parameters and that when we call a function, we pass it arguments.
