## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What data types can object properties hold?
  Any Javascript data type

- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.
  Start by declaring the object with const (if the value will not be changed) and then use an equal operator (=) followed by a curly bracket ({). Within the bracket, insert the object properties which are typed as something like firstName: "John" and then follow it with a comma if more properties are added. End the structure with an opposite curly bracket (}).
